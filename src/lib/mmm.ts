// The AI-use labels of the Me & My Machine (MMM) scheme, https://mmmlabel.tech — made by Fontys University of Applied
// Sciences with welgeen and technofilosofie.com. A label is self-declared: it says how much of a product generative AI made,
// from almost all of it to none. Ledger records who made each change; the level is the person's to declare.
// Kept free of Svelte and Tauri imports so it can be exercised on its own.
