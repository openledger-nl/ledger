//! Keeping the vault and a GitHub branch the same, without needing git installed.
//!
//! Each round is a three-way comparison per file between *base* (what both sides agreed on at the last sync,
//! kept in `.ledger/sync-state.json`), *local* (the vault on disk) and *remote* (the branch's tree):
//!
//! | local vs base | remote vs base | what happens                                           |
//! |---------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
//! | same          | changed        | the remote version is downloaded (or the file removed)  |
//! | changed       | same           | the local version is pushed (or the file removed there) |
//! | changed       | changed        | see below                                               |
//!
//! When both sides changed a file the edit is never lost: if one side deleted it, the side that edited it wins;
//! if both edited it, the local version wins and the remote one is kept in `.ledger/conflicts/`.
//!
//! The remote is a trait so the algorithm can be tested against an in-memory fake; `github.rs` is the real one.
//!
//! With encryption on, the remote is wrapped in `encrypted_remote.rs`, and what GitHub stores no longer hashes like
//! the file on disk. So the state keeps two shas per path, each compared with its own side: the plain sha with
//! the vault, the sha of the stored blob with the remote's tree. The table above is unchanged.
//!
//! Encryption never converts a branch that already holds plain files: their history would stay on GitHub, and it
//! would be too easy to believe the vault was encrypted when it wasn't. It starts on a branch that doesn't exist
//! yet (created as a fresh root commit with nothing behind it), or carries on with one that was encrypted from
//! the start. Anything else is refused, with what to do instead.
