//! What gets sent to Claude Code for a prompt, and where it runs.
//!
//! The prompt is run in its project's folder (`<vault>/projects/<project>/`): there it can read the project's
//! README (the reading guide), its threads and its other deliverables, and write the deliverable where this app
//! looks for it, in `deliverables/`. Around the prompt's own text goes a short, fixed preamble that says exactly
//! that and nothing more. The whole text is shown to the person before anything is started.
