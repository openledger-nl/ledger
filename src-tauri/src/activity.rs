//! What you did, and when: the events behind the contribution graph on the dashboard.
//!
//! Every thing you make counts once, on the moment it was made: a thread, a post you wrote, a prompt, feedback, an
//! upload, a published version, a run of a prompt with Claude Code, a user story, a task, and a code review submitted
//! with margin-code (on the moment it was submitted: a draft is still being made). What the app writes for
//! you (a template's guiding questions, the "version published" note) doesn't count, and neither do edits, which
//! leave no history. The frontend groups the events into days, in local time.
