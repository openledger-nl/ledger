# Ledger

A local desktop app for thinking in **threads**, asking for **deliverables** and giving feedback on them, and planning the work on a **board** — all inside **projects**. Tauri 2 (Rust) on the back, SvelteKit (Svelte 5) on the front. Your data is a **vault** — a folder of markdown files with YAML frontmatter, like an Obsidian vault — that can be mirrored to a private GitHub repository.

This is the rewrite of the original ASP.NET ledger, which is kept in the author's private repository (MilanMolenbrugge/ledger, commit `3ec6769`). The data model carries over in spirit, and so does the idea of plain files synced to GitHub; the shell does not. The look follows the Leerjournaal app: a dark sidebar, calm cards, one accent colour, six themes.

## How it keeps your data

```
   the vault (files)  ──load at start──▶  in-memory database  ◀── every read
         ▲                                       │
         └────────── every change, written through ┘
         │
         └── GitHub (private repo): pulled at start, pushed after changes, checked every few minutes
```

- **The vault is the source of truth.** Open it in Obsidian, grep it, put it in git yourself. Edits made outside Ledger are picked up when its window regains focus, and go to GitHub like any other change.
- **At startup** the whole vault is read into an in-memory database. Screens are answered from memory; every change is written straight back to the files (only the files that actually changed, and atomically).
- **GitHub is the store you sync to.** Ledger talks to GitHub's REST API directly, so nothing else needs installing. Each round is a three-way comparison per file against what both sides last agreed on, so changes made on two machines merge file by file. Binary files (uploads, images) sync too. If the same file was edited on both sides, this machine's version wins and the other is kept in `.ledger/conflicts/`; an edit always beats a delete. Ledger refuses to sync to a public repository.

### The vault

```
projects/<project>/project.md                       a project (name, board columns)
projects/<project>/README.md                        the project's reading guide — where to start
projects/<project>/threads/<thread>/thread.md       a thread
projects/<project>/threads/<thread>/posts/<id>.md       its posts
projects/<project>/threads/<thread>/prompts/<id>.md     its prompts: requests for deliverables
projects/<project>/threads/<thread>/feedback/<id>.md    its feedback, which lands on a deliverable
projects/<project>/threads/<thread>/uploads/<id>.md     upload manifests: when, where the file is, a description
projects/<project>/threads/<thread>/runs/<id>.md        a run of a prompt with Claude Code: how it ended, what it did
projects/<project>/userstories/<id>.md              a user story
projects/<project>/tasks/<id>.md                    a task (a card on the board)
projects/<project>/deliverables/                    what prompts produce — any kind of file;
                                                    published versions are tagged name@v0.1.ext
projects/<project>/versions/<id>.md                 how a published version came to be: who made it, the thread, prompt
                                                    and run behind it, its AI-use label
projects/<project>/attachments/                     files uploaded to a thread, screenshots included
projects/<project>/templates/<id>.md                templates for this project
templates/<id>.md                                   templates for every project
semesters/<id>.md                                   a semester (half a year) and its sprints
.ledger/                                            settings, the secret and sync bookkeeping — never synced
.gitignore                                          lists .ledger/ and .env (so the vault can also be a git repo)
```

Files Ledger doesn't know about are left alone, so the vault can hold other notes. Hand-written files are read leniently: a folder of posts without a `thread.md` is a thread, a post without frontmatter is all body, links to things that don't exist are dropped, and the repairs are written back. Files dropped into `deliverables/` by hand (or by an assistant) show up in the app.

### Choosing where the vault lives, and syncing it

**Settings → Vault** shows the folder and lets you pick another (optionally copying the current vault into it when it's empty). The location itself is the one thing kept outside the vault, in the app's config folder.

**Settings → Sync to GitHub** takes a repository (`owner/name` or a github.com URL), a branch (created on the first sync if it doesn't exist) and a repository-scoped access token. The repository and branch go in `.ledger/settings.json`, next to the other per-vault settings (the screenshot hotkey); the token goes in `.ledger/.env`:

```
GITHUB_TOKEN=github_pat_…
```

`.ledger/` is gitignored — and never uploaded even if the `.gitignore` is edited — so neither file leaves this machine. The app reads them at startup to see whether sync is set up; if everything is filled in it pulls straight away. The token never reaches the UI (only that one is saved, and its last four characters).

Use a [fine-grained token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new) limited to that one repository with **Contents: Read and write**. The repository must already have a commit (a README will do).

## What it does

- **Projects** — each has a reading guide (its `README.md`, rendered and editable on the overview), threads, deliverables, user stories, a board and templates. Deleting a project removes its folder.
- **Threads** — one per topic you're juggling. A timeline of markdown posts (replies quote their parent; edit and delete), prompts, feedback and uploads, grouped by day. Threads can be linked to each other, in both directions, and to user stories.
- **Prompts** — a request for a deliverable, written in a thread. Started from a **template**, its guiding questions are added to the thread as posts to answer first (a one-time snapshot), and replies to a question are shown inside its card. A prompt can create a deliverable (starting from the template's skeleton) or link existing ones.
- **Deliverables** — files in the project's `deliverables/`. Markdown ones are edited in the app, autosaved, in source mode (the raw markdown), live preview or reading mode, as in Obsidian; any other kind opens with the system's program. **Publish** a version (minor, major or a custom `M.m`) to freeze an immutable copy named `name@v0.1.ext`, which also drops a note in the thread of the prompt that produced it. Each deliverable has a **Produced by** window beside it (see below) and lists the feedback on it.
- **Produced by, and AI use** — every published version records who made the change: you (you typed it), Claude Code (a run started from the app, which also links the version to its prompt), or AI you say you used elsewhere. The **Produced by** window on the right of a deliverable lists its threads and under each thread what happened there, in the order set under Settings → Order (newest first unless you change it): the prompt that asked for the file, the run, each version with who made it, its size and a SHA-256, and the feedback on it. The "version published" note in a thread links to the prompt that caused the version, and quotes the changelog you wrote for it ("from changelog: …"), if you wrote one. When you publish, a checkbox says the change was made with generative AI (it starts ticked when a Claude Code run changed the file and nothing published it), and you can attach a label from the [Me & My Machine](https://mmmlabel.tech) scheme — Lazy Prompter, Piggybacker, Cyborg, Handyman or Man-Made. Ledger records the facts; the label is yours to declare, per version, because it describes the product as it stands then. Versions published before this existed show what the runs and notes prove (versions a run published are known to be AI) and otherwise "origin not recorded"; **Details** has a button to mark them. The records are plain files, so they can be edited by hand.
- **Feedback** — written in a thread, landing on a deliverable or on one of its published versions; open or resolved.
- **Uploads** — pick files in a thread (they are copied into the project's `attachments/` and noted in an `uploads/<id>.md` manifest with a description). Screenshots land the same way.
- **Templates** — a name, a "use when…" hint, guiding questions and the skeleton of the deliverable. Global ones (sidebar → Templates) serve every project; a project can *customise* one, which copies it into the project, where it replaces the shared one.
- **User stories** — an id you choose (`MM01`), a summary, "As a / I want to / Such that", notes and acceptance criteria you tick off. A story links to any number of threads.
- **Board** — per project, with customisable columns (Backlog → Doing → Done by default). Tasks can point at a story and a thread. Drag a card, or use its arrows, to change column; a column that still holds tasks can't be deleted.
- **Screenshots** — press a global hotkey (default Ctrl/⌘+Shift+S) anywhere: your own screenshot tool (Flameshot, say) or the built-in capture takes the picture, and Ledger offers to attach it to the thread you have open. Pictures sent to Ledger with "Open with" land the same way. See below.
- **Writing** — every markdown field (notes, prompts, feedback, descriptions, deliverables, templates, the reading guide) is the same inline editor ([CodeMirror 6](https://codemirror.net)). It edits the markdown itself, so the file gets exactly what you typed, but reads like the rendered page: headings, bold, code and links are shown as such and their marks fade away except where the cursor is, tables are drawn as tables until you click into one, and pictures are shown in place. Task boxes can be ticked, Ctrl/⌘+click opens a link, and Ctrl/⌘+B, I and K make bold, italic and a link.
- **Dashboard** (Home) — a card per project, the most recently active first, with its three latest threads and two latest deliverables, and links to its board and a new thread. **Pin** a project (the pin on its card) to keep it at the top. Above them, a contribution graph like GitHub's: a square per day, shaded by how much you made that day, for all projects or one. It opens on the semester you're in, with its sprints under the squares and what you made in each; pick a sprint to see only that one, or look at the last twelve months or a year. It counts what you make: threads, your posts, prompts, feedback, uploads, published versions, Claude Code runs, stories and tasks; not edits, which leave no history, nor what the app writes for you. Switch it off under Settings → Dashboard. Pins and that setting are kept per machine, like the theme.
- **Semesters** (sidebar → Semesters) — half years you set by hand: a name, a first and a last day, and the vacations in them. Each is cut into sprints of three weeks of work (or another length for all, and any sprint can have a length of its own) from its first day. The sprint clock stops for a vacation: a sprint that runs into one carries on after it, one that would start in it starts after it, and less than a week of work left at the end joins the last sprint. So the sprints always fit; you name them and give them goals. Semesters can't share days, so a day belongs to one semester at most. Kept as `semesters/<id>.md`, synced like everything else; on the dashboard's graph vacation days are outlined.
- **Dates** are shown the European way everywhere: day before month ("3 Nov 2026", typed as 03-11-2026) and a 24-hour clock. Files keep the ISO form (2026-11-03) that YAML and other tools expect; a hand-written semester may use either.
- **Search** across every post, prompt, feedback and deliverable, with highlighted snippets. **Themes**: Dark, Night, Forest, Ocean, Sepia, Light. **Order** (Settings): one choice, newest first by default, for the posts of a thread, the threads in the sidebar, and the feedback, versions and "Produced by" window of a deliverable. It only changes how things are shown. **Run prompts by themselves** (Settings → Claude Code, off by default): a prompt you create starts running in Claude Code at once, without the confirmation of what will be sent.

## Screenshots

**Settings → Screenshots** holds the hotkey and the tool. Both are stored per vault in `.ledger/settings.json`, so they are never synced, and each machine can use its own tool. The hotkey is set with a key recorder, checked (it needs a modifier, and the system's own shortcuts are refused) and registered immediately, replacing the old one without a restart; if the system won't register it (usually because another program owns it) you get a warning and the old shortcut keeps working.

When a picture arrives, Ledger holds the PNG in memory, emits `screenshot-ready`, brings its main window forward and asks where it goes. With a thread open that is a short confirmation (that thread, an optional description, Enter); *Change…* or no open thread gives the full choice of project and thread (or a new one). *Attach* saves the PNG in the project's `attachments/`, writes the upload manifest and opens the thread at it; *Discard* drops it. Failures are shown the same way.

### Your own tool (bring your own)

Choose **My own tool** and give a command. Ledger runs it when the hotkey is pressed; it is split into a program and its arguments by Ledger itself (spaces separate, quotes group, backslashes are kept), so it means the same everywhere and needs no shell.

- With `{file}` in it, Ledger fills in a fresh temporary `.png` path, waits for the tool to exit and reads the file.
- Without `{file}`, Ledger reads the PNG the tool prints.
- No picture means cancelled, unless the tool printed an error (anything but an "aborted"/"cancelled" message), which is shown.

Presets, offered in Settings with whether the program was found:

| | Command |
|---|---|
| Linux, Flameshot | `flameshot gui --raw` |
| macOS, built-in picker | `screencapture -i {file}` |
| macOS, Flameshot | `/Applications/flameshot.app/Contents/MacOS/flameshot gui -p {file}` |
| Windows, Flameshot | `"C:\Program Files\Flameshot\bin\flameshot.exe" gui -p {file}` |

### Opened with Ledger

A PNG passed to Ledger on the command line becomes the screenshot waiting to be attached; a second launch is handed to the running app by [tauri-plugin-single-instance](https://crates.io/crates/tauri-plugin-single-instance), and on macOS opened files arrive as `RunEvent::Opened`. That is what Flameshot's *Open with* (Ctrl+O in its editor) uses.

- **Linux**: the .deb and .rpm install a desktop entry with `Exec=ledger %F` and `MimeType=image/png` (`src-tauri/linux/ledger.desktop`, set in `tauri.linux.conf.json`), so Ledger is listed. With `tauri dev` there is no desktop entry; to try it, put one in `~/.local/share/applications` whose `Exec` is `src-tauri/target/debug/ledger %F`.
- **macOS**: `tauri.macos.conf.json` declares PNG with rank *Alternate*: Ledger appears under Finder's *Open With* but never becomes the default viewer.
- **Windows**: no file association, because Tauri's installer would make Ledger the default PNG program. Pick `Ledger.exe` through *Open with → Look for another app on this PC*.

### The built-in capture

Used when no tool is chosen. It is meant to be removable (the list of what to delete is at `builtin` in `src-tauri/src/screenshot.rs`).

- **Windows, macOS**: the monitor under the cursor is captured ([xcap](https://crates.io/crates/xcap)); a frameless, always-on-top window shows it so you can drag out a region (Esc or a right-click cancels); the backend crops it, scaling the drag from window units to capture pixels so HiDPI screens come out exact. macOS needs the Screen Recording permission: Ledger checks it before capturing, triggers the system prompt the first time, and otherwise says where to switch it on (Ledger must be restarted afterwards). The overlay is opaque on macOS (a transparent window needs Tauri's `macos-private-api`).
- **Linux**: the desktop's screenshot portal ([ashpd](https://crates.io/crates/ashpd)), with the compositor's own area picker. xcap isn't built on Linux: it pulls in PipeWire, which needs `libpipewire-0.3-dev` and libclang just to compile.

Under Wayland the hotkey is bound through the global-shortcuts portal; if the desktop doesn't offer it, Settings says so and the *Take a screenshot now* button still works.

The built-in capture on Windows is exercised end to end. The macOS paths, and the Flameshot presets on Windows and macOS, have been type-checked but not run.

## Running it

Install a release to use Ledger and get updates from inside the app; build it from source to work on it.

### Installing a release

Every [release](https://github.com/openledger-nl/ledger/releases) carries installers:

| System | Download |
|---|---|
| Windows (64-bit) | `Ledger_X.Y.Z_x64-setup.exe`: installs for your account only, no administrator needed |
| macOS (Apple silicon and Intel) | `Ledger_X.Y.Z_universal.dmg`: open it and drag Ledger to Applications |
| Linux (x86-64) | `Ledger_X.Y.Z_amd64.AppImage` (`chmod +x` it and run it), or the `.deb` / `.rpm` for your package manager |

The installers aren't signed with a Windows or Apple developer certificate yet, so the first start needs one extra step:

- **Windows**: SmartScreen says "Windows protected your PC". Click **More info**, then **Run anyway**. Your browser may also ask whether to keep the download.
- **macOS**: the first time you open Ledger, macOS says it can't check it for malicious software and won't open it. Click **Done**, open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, find "Ledger was blocked to protect your Mac" and click **Open Anyway**, then confirm. (Before macOS 15, right-clicking Ledger in Applications and choosing **Open** also works.) Without a developer certificate, macOS may ask again for the Screen Recording permission after an update.
- **Linux**: nothing extra. The `.deb` and `.rpm` also add the desktop entry that *Open with* uses (see [Screenshots](#screenshots)).

Updates don't need these steps again: Ledger downloads them itself and checks their signature.

### Updates

Ledger looks for a new release shortly after it starts and every few hours. When one is out, a notice in the corner shows the version and what changed, with **Install and restart** and **Later**. A major version (the first number goes up) and its breaking changes stand out: something you rely on may work differently afterwards. **Later** hides the notice until the next check. Nothing is installed until you click **Install and restart**.

Installing downloads the new version and checks that it is signed with Ledger's key (the public half is built into the app, `plugins.updater` in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`); an update with a wrong or missing signature is refused, and the notice says so. It then waits until a restart cuts nothing off: a GitHub or Trello sync that is running finishes first, and if Claude Code is still running a prompt, you choose between waiting for it and stopping it. Then Ledger installs and restarts. Every change you make is written to the vault straight away, and changes not yet on GitHub are pushed when Ledger starts again. An update replaces the program only: the vault, its `.ledger/` folder and Ledger's config are left alone.

**Settings → About** shows the version you have and has **Check for updates**. To stop the automatic checks, untick **Check for updates automatically** there; **Check for updates** still works. The choice belongs to this computer, not to the vault: it is kept in Ledger's `config.json` in the app's config folder (next to the vault's location), so another computer syncing the same vault keeps its own.

Ledger built from source with `pnpm run tauri dev` (or any debug build) never looks for updates; its Settings → About can simulate one, to try the notice. A release build you make yourself does look, and offers the official releases.

### Building from source

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 26 (the version in `.nvmrc`; `nvm use` picks it) with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) (`corepack enable` activates the version pinned in `package.json`), a Rust toolchain and the [Tauri prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your platform (on Windows: the MSVC build tools and WebView2).

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run tauri dev     # the app, with hot reload
pnpm run tauri build   # an installer / bundle for this machine
```

A local `tauri build` makes the installers but not the updater's signatures: those need the private key, which only CI has.

Checks:

```bash
pnpm test              # Rust: stores, vault round-trips, and the sync algorithm against a fake GitHub
pnpm run check         # Svelte + TypeScript
```

Environment variables, mostly for development: `LEDGER_VAULT` fixes the vault location (and locks it in Settings); `LEDGER_CONFIG_DIR` moves the per-machine settings (the vault location, whether to check for updates); `LEDGER_GITHUB_API` points the sync at another API base (GitHub Enterprise, or a mock).

To send a change, read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md): the checks, and how to write the commits.

## Versions and releases

Every push to `main` that brings [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) is released by CI
([.github/workflows/release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml)). The commits since the last release decide the bump,
the largest one wins:

| Commit | Bump | Example |
|---|---|---|
| a breaking change: `feat!:`, `fix(sync)!:`, or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer | major | 0.4.2 → 1.0.0 |
| `feat:` | minor | 0.4.2 → 0.5.0 |
| any other type: `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `docs`, `style`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert` | patch | 0.4.2 → 0.4.3 |

Changes reach `main` as pull requests merged with a merge commit, so every commit on a branch lands as it is and
counts (merge commits don't); [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) lists the types and scopes a commit may use, and a
check holds every commit in a pull request to them.

Commits that aren't conventional are left out; with none that count, there is no release. The version is written to
`package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` (the app shows the Cargo one), the
notes go to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), and CI commits that as `chore(release): vX.Y.Z`, tags it `vX.Y.Z` and
creates the GitHub release as a draft. It then builds the installers from the tag on Windows, macOS and Linux, signs
them for the updater with the password-less key in the repository secret `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`, uploads them with
their `.sig` files and the `latest.json` the app reads, and publishes the release once every platform has been built. A
release whose build failed stays a draft, which the app never sees. Don't bump versions by hand.

`main` only takes pull requests (the `protected-main` ruleset), so CI pushes that release commit and tag with a deploy
key the ruleset lets through: the write key whose private half is the Actions secret `RELEASE_DEPLOY_KEY`.

```bash
pnpm release:preview   # what the next release would be, and its notes; changes nothing
```

## Not carried over from the legacy app

The read-only MCP server, PDF export, and the backfill command for old version notes. There is no migration: the legacy content repository used `meta.json` and `*.json` files and a different structure, and Ledger starts from an empty vault.
